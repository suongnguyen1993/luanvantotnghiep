That was the last shipment this year from our warehouse, which is in Montreal.&nbsp;<br />\r\nTo be honest, I have never experienced carnation sales like this during my twenty-year career in the flower industry.

Since that television show, I have struggled to keep up with the growing demand for carnations in all colors and types.&nbsp;<br />\r\nIf you still need to receive the additional boxes of carnations, please contact me as soon as possible.
